# Overview
This service can manage authors and their books. Endpoints support creation of new authors
and books as well as to list them.

The description of a book is automatically generated by ChatGPT. As a small addition I added
an endpoint that returns a joke for a known book.
```
GET /authors
GET /authors/{id}
POST /authors

GET /books
GET /books/{id}
POST /books

POST /jokes
```

# How to run this
Build the artifact via maven `mvn clean install` and run it using Java 17.
Alternatively you can use the included wrappers on a Linux like system
- `./mvnw clean install`
- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

or on Windows
- `mvnw.cmd clean install`
- `mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`

# Assumptions
I assumed, among other things, that
- another DB would be used in a real service (just in-memory H2 here)
- full test coverage would be added
- chat gpt answers don't need to be validated
- it is fine to wait for chat gpt messages and fail if this call fails/times out

# Future improvements
If this were a real service some things could be improved in the future such as
- more validation of inputs and possible business logic if needed
- endpoints for updates
- pagination & filters for list endpoints
- new logic like recommendations or book lists
